## About Me

Growing up on a farm, I learned the value of perseverance and hard work. Through my journey of self-guided learning, I have harnessed the knowledge of React, Solidity, and JavaScript.

I am a dedicated smart contract security researcher who actively engages in audits on Code4rena individually and on teams. These challenges both teach me and keep me up-to-date on the latest smart contract best practices.

My commitment to building secure web3 technologies remains at the forefront of my work. This reflects my passion for delivering high-quality and secure solutions in the blockchain space.
